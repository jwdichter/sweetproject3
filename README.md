#Sweetproject 2: The Return of Sweetproject
###Plot Summary
Once upon a time, there was a young lad who was skilled at the art of drawing stick figure animals.  People were skilled at his incredible talents, so they resorted to attempting to bring down his morale.  However, he had a strong will and was unaffected by their futile attempts, so he kept drawing.  The End.
###Thanks
Thanks to the following: Dr. Munro for inevitably giving me a spot on varsity tennis, Dave Fan for absolutely nothing, the Hawleywood crew for taking over the KHL, BD Investments ("The Finest in Investing/3v3 Basketball") for just being awesome, Atkins for not being Clay, Spring Break, the Orlando Trip, everyone also failing BC Calc (me), everyone not failing BC Calc (not me), and to Mr. Torres for giving us a great project the week before Spring Break.
